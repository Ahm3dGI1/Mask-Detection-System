We have designed COVID-BUSTER, a mobile application that offers users COVID-related statistics such as the number of people in a certain location, the percentage of people who are taking precautionary measures, and the risk of infection there. This data is obtained via an AI-based backend system that has been designed to be installed on public places' cameras to collect data and push it to the server.

To open the program, please follow these steps:
- Make sure that you have these packages installed: [Python - TensorFlow - Keras - Imutils - NumPy - OpenCV - matplotlib - scipy].
- Open the terminal window and navigate to the program folder.
- Write the following command: "python main.py"
